# Starbucks Nutritional AnalysisðŸ§‹

Welcome to the Starbucks Nutritional Analysis project. This project dives into the nutritional information of various beverages offered by the popular coffee chain, Starbucks. 

## Project Description

The project begins with the extraction of nutritional data from the `starbucks.csv` dataset. The data covers a wide range of beverages and their nutritional components like calories, fat content, sugar levels, and more.

### Key Aspects of the Project:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Importing necessary libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation.
   - Loading the Starbucks dataset and performing initial data exploration.
   - Renaming column names for ease of access and analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Using the `describe()` function to view statistical information like mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical columns.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Transforming certain columns (like vitamin percentages) from strings to numerical values for better analysis.

4. **Specific Queries and Analysis:**
   - Answering targeted questions like finding suitable drinks for diabetics or gym-goers based on sugar and protein content.
   - Identifying beverages with the highest calorie content and analyzing the vitamin content in different beverages.

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Employing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual analysis.
   - Creating various plots like scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms to visualize relationships between different nutritional elements.

6. **Conclusions:**
   - Drawing conclusions about the nutritional value of Starbucks beverages, with an emphasis on health considerations.
